# Basic-Data-Structures-in-C
I am a Computer Science Undergrad at IIIT-Bhubaneswar.
With this repositry, I hope the next batches wouldn't have to google their Lab Questions
And just take it from here.
This repository contains all the basic operations of different Data Structures.

Every constructive criticism would be appreciated.

Thank You.
